# Data lab notebooks

This GitHub repo contains several tutorial notebooks designed to present the essentials of R, Python and pandas.
The notebooks where created on a Professional Databricks shard and should be runnable on any platform with a compatible version of R, Python or pandas.
See <http://databricks.com> for info on Databricks.
Each notebook should indicate the version it uses.
If either is not the case, I'll appreciate an email letting me know.

The notebooks were authored by research assistants of the Data Lab at Bentley University in Waltham, MA (just outside of Boston).
Please direct any feedback, comments or suggestions to David Oury <doury@bentley.edu>. Thanks.
